Pomelo quiz
==========================
_Test task for back-end position_

There are two ways to check solution:

1) local installation,
2) using of ready-to-test installation @glitch.com

Both postman's collections are included.
You have ability to read/edit code* @glitch.com

https://glitch.com/edit/#!/battle-soldier

*and run it too if you provide your own URI for mongo DB in .env file and change related settings in lib/db/mongoose.js

**Keep in mind that some time will be needed for start app instance @glitch.com

In case of local installation you have to provide information about mongo in
config.json

You can populate mongo base with data from this file by execute
```
generateData.js
```

Postman's collections (for local and glitch.com) and environment are included in solution.
